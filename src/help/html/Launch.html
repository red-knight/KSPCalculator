		<h1>Launch Orbits (Highly Experimental)</h1>
		<p>This calculator is for calculating your initial orbit when you launch your ship. However it is highly experimental.</p>
		<p><img src="fig4-07.jpg" /></p>
		<p>The following Values need to be entered:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Velocity of the rocket at burnout, meaning how fast your ship goes once you turn off your engine(s)</li>
			<li>The Altitude of the rocket at burnout, meaning how high your ship is once you turn off your engine(s)</li>
			<li>The Velocity Vector of the rocket at burnout, meaning the angle your ship goes once you turn off your engine(s)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Please note that I'm not sure what the Velocity Vector actually is, so this feature, while being correctly implemented, 
		is pretty much useless at this stage of the KSP development.</p>
 		<p>The Calculator will return the following Values:</p>
 		<ul>
 			<li>The Orbital Velocity of the current Orbit, meaning how fast your ship needs to be to orbit in this height</li>
 			<li>The Orbital Period of the current Orbit, meaning how much time your ship need to complete one orbit</li>
 			<li>The Escape Velocity of the current Orbit, meaning how fast your ship needs to be to escape the gravity of KEarth</li>
 		</ul>
 		<p>If you press the 'Show Orbit' button, a window will open that shows a representation of the orbit around KEarth</p>
