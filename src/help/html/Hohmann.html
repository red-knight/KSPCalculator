		<h1>Hohmann Transfer Orbits</h1>
		<p>The aim of this calculator is to allow the calculation of a low energy Hohmann Transfer Orbit, which allows 
		to change orbits with a minimal use of energy/propellant/fuel.</p>
		<p>The following values must be entered:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The low orbits altitude</li>
			<li>The high orbits altitude</li>
			<li>The selection if you want to go from the low orbit to the high orbit, or the other way around</li>
		</ul>
 		<p>The Calculator will return the following Values:</p>
 		<ul>
 			<li>The Initial Velocity of the starting orbit, followed by the &Delta;v (meaning velocity difference) to get 
 			into the transfer orbit, which is again followed by the speed you need in the transfer orbit</li>
 			<li>The Initial Velocity of the Hohmann orbit when you approach the target orbit, followed by the &Delta;v 
 			(meaning velocity difference) to get into the target orbit, which is again followed by the speed you need in 
 			the target orbit</li>
 			<li>The complete &Delta;v you need to change orbits</li>
 			<li>The period of the entire Hohmann Orbit, if you want to keep orbiting in the Hohmann orbit</li>
 			<li>The half period of the Hohmann Orbit, meaning how much time the manouver needs to be completed</li> 
 		</ul>
 		<p>If you press the 'Show Orbit' button, a window will open that shows a representation of the orbit around KEarth</p>
