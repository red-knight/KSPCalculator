		<h1>Multi Stage Calculator</h1>
		<p>A simple calculator that allows basic calculation of all a multi stage rocket needs. 
			At the moment it does not take any burned out Solid Rocket Boosters into account.</p>
		<p>Once the KSP Main directory is added to the configuration, its will be possible to use custom parts as well.</p>
		<p>You can add, delete and <strike>change</strike> stages and get the following results:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A list of stages with their individual informations</li>
			<li>The total weight of the rocket</li>
			<li>The total dry weight of the rocket</li>
			<li>The total &Delta;v of the rocket</li>
			<li>The Thrust to Weight Ratio at the moment of lift off</li>
		</ul>
