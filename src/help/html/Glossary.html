		<ul>
			<li>Periapsis/Perigee: In an elliptical orbit, the point of the orbit closest to the planet</li>
			<li>Apoapsis/Apogee: In an elliptical orbit, the point of the orbit farthest from the planet</li>
			<li>Eccentricity: A Scalar of how non-circular an orbit is.
				<ul>
    				<li>ecc = 0 => circular orbit</li>
    				<li>0 < ecc < 1 => elliptical orbit</li>
    				<li> ecc = 1 => parabolic orbit - this is an escape orbit</li>
    				<li> ecc > 1 => hyperbolic orbit - this is an escape orbit</li>
    			</ul>
    		</li>
    		<li>Sub-Orbital: Any trajectory that will lead an object (rocketload of kerbals) back to the ground.</li>
			<li>Prograde: The "forward" direction of your orbital path. Since orbits are elliptical, it's actually 
			the tangent of the orbit where the ship is.</li>
			<li>Retrograde: The reverse of Prograde, "backwards".</li>
			<li>Zenith: "Up" in ground-relative coordinates, i.e. the direction your rocket points at when at the 
			launchpad, aka: "the highest point in the sky".</li>
			<li>Nadir: opposite direction of "Zenith".</li>
			<li>&Delta;v: A change in velocity, it is positive, wether it is slowing down of speeding up.</li>
