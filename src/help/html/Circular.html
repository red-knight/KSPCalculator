		<h1>Circular Orbits</h1>
		<p>For this Calculator its a simple thing of typing an Altitude above ground into the Input field,
 		selecting if the value is in meters or kilometers and pressing the 'Calculate' button.</p>
 		<p>The Calculator will return the following Values:</p>
 		<ul>
 			<li>The Orbital Velocity of the current Orbit, meaning how fast your ship needs to be to orbit in this height</li>
 			<li>The Orbital Period of the current Orbit, meaning how much time your ship need to complete one orbit</li>
 			<li>The Escape Velocity of the current Orbit, meaning how fast your ship needs to be to escape the gravity of KEarth</li>
 		</ul>
 		<p>If you press the 'Show Orbit' button, a window will open that shows a representation of the orbit around KEarth</p>
