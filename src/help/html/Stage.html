		<h1>Stage Calculator</h1>
		<p>A simple calculator to calculate all you need for a stage. However its only for vanilla KSP and does not yet 
			support any custom parts.</p>
		<p>Once the KSP Main directory is added to the configuration, its will be possible to use custom parts as well.</p>		
		<p>The Calculator will return the following Values:</p>
 		<ul>
 			<li>The full and empty weights of the stage</li>
 			<li>The Specific Impulse of the stage</li>
 			<li>The thrust of the stages engines</li>
 			<li>The presumed &Delta;v of the stage</li>
 		</ul>
