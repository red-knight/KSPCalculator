		<h1>Elliptic Orbits</h1>
		<p>With this calculator you can choose between the values you enter:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Perigee and Apogee Altitudes, meaning the Altitude of your ship in the highest and lowest points of the orbit</li>
			<li>Perigee Altitude and Velocity, meaning how high and fast your ship is at the lowest point of the orbit</li>
			<li>Apogee Altitude and Velocity, meaning how high and fast your ship is at the highest point of the orbit</li>
		</ul>
 		<p>The Calculator will return the following Values:</p>
 		<ul>
 			<li>The Orbital Velocities of the current Orbit in the Perigee and the Apogee, meaning how fast your ship  
 				orbits around KEarth in the highest and lowest points of the orbit</li>
 			<li>The Orbital Altitudes of the current Orbit in the Perigee and the Apogee, meaning how high your ship  
 				orbits above KEarth in the highest and lowest points of the orbit</li>
 			<li>The Orbital Period of the current Orbit, meaning how much time your ship need to complete one orbit</li>
 			<li>The Orbital Eccentricity of the current Orbit, meaning how far the orbit is away from an ideal circular orbit.</li>
 		</ul>
 		<p>If you press the 'Show Orbit' button, a window will open that shows a representation of the orbit around KEarth</p>
